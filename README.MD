Utilized the MERN stack to build a robust ecommerce website. Leveraging MongoDB for database management, Express.js for server-side development, React for dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js for server-side JavaScript execution, I created a platform that seamlessly manages large
volumes of data and third-party integrations, providing a seamless shopping experience for customers.
